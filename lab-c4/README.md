##Reviewed Group 2

-Based on the information provided by Group 2, you wouldn't be able to optimally implement Connect 4, especially if you weren't sure about what the program was.

-While the relative general idea is given, functions have little to no outlined specifics, leaving most everything up to interpretation.

-Project did not explicitly break down tasks, and assumes almost full knowledge of the desired result.
